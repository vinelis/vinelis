### Hi there, I'm Luca üëã

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) with a strong passion for ensuring software quality. My goal is to join a dynamic team where I can contribute to both manual testing strategies and the development of robust automation frameworks.

I am driven by the challenge of understanding complex systems and applying both analytical skills and a technical mindset to deliver high-quality products.

### üöÄ Featured Project

#### üî∑ QA Automation Framework - Selenium & Java
[https://github.com/vinelis/qa-web-ui-java](https://github.com/vinelis/qa-web-ui-java)

A complete UI test automation framework built from scratch to validate a real estate web application.

The main challenge was to create a **scalable and maintainable architecture** that could support both traditional and BDD testing approaches. I implemented the **Page Object Model (POM)** for clean code separation and integrated **Allure** to generate advanced, detailed reports, including **automatic screenshots on test failure** for rapid debugging. The framework also includes a **Cucumber** layer to write tests in a human-readable format, covering various data scenarios.

* **Tech Stack:** `Java`, `Selenium`, `TestNG`, `Cucumber`, `Maven`, `Allure Report`
